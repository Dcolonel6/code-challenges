# [Count distinct elements in every window](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/count-distinct-elements-in-every-window/1)

Given an integer array **arr[]** and a number **k**. Find the count of distinct elements in every window of size k in the array.

## Examples:

**Input:** arr[] = [1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 2, 3], k = 4  
**Output:**  [3, 4, 4, 3]  
**Explanation:** Window 1 of size k = 4 is 1 2 1 3. Number of distinct elements in this window are 3.   
Window 2 of size k = 4 is 2 1 3 4. Number of distinct elements in this window are 4.  
Window 3 of size k = 4 is 1 3 4 2. Number of distinct elements in this window are 4.  
Window 4 of size k = 4 is 3 4 2 3. Number of distinct elements in this window are 3.  

**Input:** arr[] = [4, 1, 1], k = 2  
**Output:** [2, 1]  
**Explanation:** Window 1 of size k = 2 is 4 1. Number of distinct elements in this window are 2.   
Window 2 of size k = 2 is 1 1. Number of distinct elements in this window is 1.   

**Input:** arr[] = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], k = 3  
**Output:** [1, 1, 1]  

## Constraints:
- 1 <= k <= arr.size() <= 105  
- 1 <= arr[i] <= 105
